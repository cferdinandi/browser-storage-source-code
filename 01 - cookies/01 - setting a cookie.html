			 	Cookie Settings

			 	- path={path} - The path to set the cookie at. Defaults to the current path. It might be a good idea to set this to the root path: path=/.
			 	- domain={domain} - The domain for the cookie. Defaults to the current host name.
			 	- max-age={max age in seconds} - The maximum amount of time to keep the cookie, in seconds.
			 	- expires={date in GMT form} - A date on which to expire the cookie.
			 	- secure - The cookie can only be transmitted over HTTPS.
			 	- same-site={lax|strict|none} - Whether or not the browser can send the cookie to other sites. The default, lax, only sends with same-site requests and navigation GET requests; strict does not send to any external sites, even when following a link; and none does not place any restrictions.
